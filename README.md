# arxiv_cross_listings
plot of cross-listings on arxiv, January 2017

This python code accesses metadata on arxiv.org from January 2017, using an API script by Lucas Schwab, available here: 
https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py . You will need his code (under the file name arxiv.py) to run the python 
code I've written. 

Possible improvements: I'm still exploring better ways to visualize the data. 

NB: code takes a while to run because I implemented a 5 second wait time before each request to arxiv.org.
